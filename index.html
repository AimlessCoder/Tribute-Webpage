                <p class="para">Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose emerged as a prominent 
                    figure in India's struggle for independence. Growing up in a family of intellectuals, Bose imbibed 
                    the values of patriotism and social reform from an early age. His education at Cambridge University 
                    in England broadened his horizons and exposed him to nationalist movements, shaping his ideological awakening.</p>

                <p class="topic">Early Years and Education:</p>
                <p class="para">Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, India. Hailing from a prominent 
                    Bengali family, he displayed leadership qualities from a young age. After completing his schooling in Cuttack, 
                    Netaji traveled to England to pursue higher education at Cambridge University. It was during his time at Cambridge 
                    that he became involved with Indian nationalist groups and developed a fervent desire to see India free from British rule.</p>

                <p class="para">Upon returning to India, Bose was deeply moved by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919, which fueled his passion 
                    for Indian freedom. He joined the Indian National Congress (INC) and quickly rose through the ranks, advocating for 
                    full independence from British rule. Recognizing his exceptional leadership qualities, Bose was elected as the president 
                    of the All India Youth Congress in 1929, marking the beginning of his influential role in shaping India's destiny.</p>

                <p class="para">During this period, Bose grew increasingly dissatisfied with the moderate approach of the INC leadership. He 
                    believed in more direct and radical methods to achieve independence. In 1939, he formed the Forward Bloc, a political 
                    group aimed at uniting all anti-British forces and advocating for complete liberation. The Forward Bloc became a platform 
                    for Bose to voice his vision of a free and self-reliant India.</p>

                <p class="para">Placed under house arrest by the British authorities, Bose decided to escape India in 1941 to seek international support for 
                    the cause of Indian independence. His remarkable journey took him through Afghanistan and the Soviet Union, ultimately leading him to Germany. 
                    In his pursuit of assistance, Bose sought alliances with leaders and governments worldwide, including Adolf Hitler's Germany and Imperial Japan.</p>

                <p class="para">In Germany, Bose established the Indian Legion, composed of Indian prisoners of war who pledged allegiance to the cause of Indian 
                    independence. This marked the birth of the Indian National Army (INA), also known as Azad Hind Fauj. With the INA, Bose led military 
                    campaigns against the British, primarily in Burma and Northeast India. The INA's victories instilled a renewed sense of pride and 
                    resistance among the Indian populace, shaking the foundations of British colonial rule.</p>
